This is an easy problem. Especially when efficiency is not a big issue here.

For each directory you want to create, we get all the directories you need.
Those are all the ancestors of that directory. For example, if one items in the
input of wanted directories is

    /home/gcj/round1b/problema/input

We need all the following

    /home
    /home/gcj
    /home/gcj/round1b
    /home/gcj/round1b/problema
    /home/gcj/round1b/problema/input

Let A be the collection of all the directories we need, and B be the collection
of all the directories that are already exist. Simply count how many elements
are from A but not B. You need to use one mkdir for each of them.
