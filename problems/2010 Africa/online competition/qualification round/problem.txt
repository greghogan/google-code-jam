Problem

You've just advanced from the Qualification Round of Google Code Jam Africa
2010, and you want to know how many of your fellow contestants advanced with
you. To give yourself a challenge, you've decided only to look at how many
people solved each problem.

The Qualification Round consisted of P problems; the ith problem was fully
solved by Si contestants. Contestants had to solve C problems in order to
advance to the next round. Your job is to figure out, using only that
information, the maximum number of contestants who could have advanced.

Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow.
Each will consist only of space-separated integers: first P, then C, then P
integers S0...SP-1.

Output

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the
case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum number of contestants who
could have advanced (in other words, the maximum number of contestants who
could have solved at least C problems).

Limits

  1 ≤ T ≤ 100
  1 ≤ C ≤ P

Small dataset

  1 ≤ P ≤ 6
  0 ≤ Si ≤ 1000

Large dataset

  1 ≤ P ≤ 60
  0 ≤ Si ≤ 10^17
